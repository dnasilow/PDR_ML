## Service Area Phrasing Options

**Option 1: Direct and Clear**

*   **Text:** "Mobile PDR service within a 1-hour drive of Fraserburgh and Aberdeenshire."
*   **Pros:** Simple, direct, and easy to understand.
*   **Cons:** A bit functional, could be more polished.

**Option 2: Customer-Focused**

*   **Text:** "Serving customers within a 1-hour drive from Fraserburgh and throughout Aberdeenshire."
*   **Pros:** Puts the focus on the customer and clearly defines the service radius.
*   **Cons:** Slightly longer.

**Option 3: Professional and Concise**

*   **Text:** "Expert mobile PDR services available within a 1-hour radius of Fraserburgh and across Aberdeenshire."
*   **Pros:** Sounds professional, uses strong keywords ("expert mobile PDR services"), and is concise.
*   **Cons:** "Radius" might be slightly less common phrasing for some users.

**Option 4: Benefit-Oriented**

*   **Text:** "Get fast, convenient PDR service at your location within a 1-hour drive of Fraserburgh or anywhere in Aberdeenshire."
*   **Pros:** Highlights the benefits of the mobile service (fast, convenient).
*   **Cons:** Longest option, might be too wordy for some sections.

**Recommendation:**

For the main contact and footer sections, **Option 3** is the strongest choice. It is professional, concise, and effectively communicates the service area. It sounds the most polished and credible.

For the contact form or a dedicated service area page, **Option 4** could be used to provide more detail and highlight the customer benefits.

Therefore, I will proceed with **Option 3** for the primary service area descriptions on the website.
