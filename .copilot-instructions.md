ROJECT CONTEXT

This repository contains an in-progress website project for a Dent Master Aberdeenshire (for Paintless Dent Repair) and minor mechanical repair business.
Your objective is to review, refactor, and complete the project to professional production standards — ensuring performance, SEO, accessibility, and user experience meet modern web expectations.

The site must represent:

Professionalism, precision, and trustworthiness.

Local identity (Scotland / UK English).

Modern responsive design suitable for automotive repair services.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Conduct a comprehensive code and design audit, then modify or complete the website until it is ready for public deployment and client satisfaction.

PHASE 1 — CODE & ARCHITECTURE REVIEW

Identify frontend and backend frameworks (React, Next.js, Node.js, etc.).

Enumerate and validate dependencies (stability, security, redundancy).

Check folder structure and component hierarchy for maintainability.

Detect unused components, scripts, or styles and clean them.

Confirm proper modularization and DRY principles.

Run performance analysis (Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals).

PHASE 2 — FRONTEND OPTIMIZATION

Ensure full responsiveness and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).

Maintain a consistent design system (Tailwind recommended).

Refactor inconsistent spacing, typography, and colors.

Use semantic HTML5 and ARIA attributes.

Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading, compression).

Implement modern UI transitions and visual polish.

PHASE 3 — FUNCTIONAL COMPLETION

Implement or fix the following features:

Quote Request Form with image upload and validation.

Callback or Booking Request form with spam protection.

Google Maps Integration showing service area.

Testimonials / Reviews Section with carousel or grid.

SEO Metadata for “Paintless Dent Repair Scotland”, “dent removal”, “scratch repair”, etc.

Analytics Integration (GA4 or Plausible).

Ensure forms work end-to-end with correct data handling and user feedback.

PHASE 4 — SEO & LOCALIZATION

Write optimized meta titles, descriptions, and canonical URLs.

Implement JSON-LD structured data (LocalBusiness schema).

Generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Include Open Graph / Twitter Card metadata.

Use British English and local terminology (e.g., “bonnet”, “tyre”).

Ensure GDPR compliance and cookie consent.

Include VAT number, address, and business registration where applicable.

PHASE 5 — QUALITY ASSURANCE

Test across all major browsers and viewports.

Validate Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals, and accessibility (≥ 90 score).

Run integration tests for forms and dynamic content.

Check console for runtime warnings or errors.

Document fixes and performance metrics in /docs/FINAL_REVIEW_REPORT.md.

DEPLOYMENT TARGETS

Default hosting: Vercel (preferred) or Netlify.

Recommended stack:

Next.js 14 (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Node.js API routes or Express backend

PostgreSQL or Supabase (for persistent forms)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Clean, production-ready codebase with clear comments.

Consistent design system and optimized performance.

Complete SEO and local compliance integration.

Deployed version or deploy-ready configuration.

Markdown-based audit and changelog documentation.

EXECUTION GUIDELINES

Use modular, scalable, and documented code.

Respect existing design and improve without overhauling unless required.

Prioritize readability, maintainability, and UX clarity.

Document major architectural or functional changes in /docs/audit.md.

Maintain consistency with UK web accessibility and privacy standards.

EXPECTED OUTCOME

A fully functional, responsive, and high-performing website representing a local Scottish PDR & automotive repair brand — optimized for conversions, discoverability, and long-term maintainability.
