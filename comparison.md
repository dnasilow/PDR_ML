## Comparison of Inspiration Sites and Adapted Elements

Here is a summary of the key elements that will be adapted from the two inspiration websites:

*   **Hero Section with Strong CTA:** Both sites feature a prominent hero section with a clear value proposition. We will adopt this approach, creating a professional hero with clear contact CTAs, similar to pdrpoint.com.pl's "Wyceń usługę" (Estimate service) and pdrprofessionalteam.eu's direct contact information.
*   **Detailed Services Section:** We will create a services grid, inspired by both sites, to clearly outline the different services offered. This will be a visually engaging way to present the information, similar to the grid on pdrpoint.com.pl.
*   **Trust and Credibility Markers:** We will include sections for case studies, certifications, and team profiles, drawing inspiration from both sites. Pdrpoint.com.pl's "Certyfikacja PDR" and client testimonials, along with pdrprofessionalteam.eu's team profiles and partner logos, are good models.
*   **Multilingual Support and GDPR Compliance:** We will incorporate multilingual support, as seen on pdrprofessionalteam.eu, and a clear GDPR cookie banner, as both sites have, to ensure the website is accessible and compliant.
*   **Downloadable Resources:** The concept of a "Strefa wiedzy" (Knowledge Zone) from pdrpoint.com.pl will be adapted to include downloadable PDFs, providing valuable resources to potential clients.
