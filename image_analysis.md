# Images to Restore from Previous Version

Based on the previous version at https://pdrscot-a4qv9p.manus.space/, the following images were present:

## Hero Section Images:
1. **Background car image** - Luxury car in the hero section background
2. **PDR technique demonstration** - Image showing hands working on a car panel (right side of hero)

## Services Section Images:
1. **"What is Paintless Dent Removal?"** - Car panel with dent, educational image
2. **PDR Work in Progress** - Technician using PDR tools on a car
3. **Professional PDR Tools** - Collection of PDR tools and equipment

## Current Issues:
1. Images are missing in the current version
2. "Get a Quote" button doesn't navigate to a quote page
3. Need to rename "Realizations" to "Gallery"
4. Need to create a multi-page structure

## Action Plan:
1. Search for and add appropriate PDR images
2. Create a separate quote page
3. Update navigation to support multi-page structure
4. Create gallery page structure organized by car models
